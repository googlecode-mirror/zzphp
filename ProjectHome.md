The intend is create two php modules to run funcoes zz directly by php with out explicit system or exec or correlated funciont.

All the functions have you answers adapted and the you got arrays and not more the original text message provided by bash

The first module is a bind and is recommended for how think to stay up to date with the funcoes zz(you need install it)
I working on this now.

The second module is planned to by self independent, so, I need rewrite all functions(and it is a herculeos effort).
This module is planned... only planned, in ideas plan of mind ;)
